Usage:

simple as it is, just check what you want to disable and it's done. The is an info_path.txt file with paths of what 
is changed for easy track of any errors. Any helpers/contributors good at programming are very welcomed. My limited skills on c#, makes the tool to look like a mess, 
but it's working as intended :)

Concerning of being banned by GGG,...disabling effects that are causing a super computer to lag and playing with headaches...
i don't think GGG have that low self respect to ban any of VisualGGPK users, and never heard of someone being banned for that anyway 
(but who knows..nothing is 100% sure).

enjoy
